<P>Writing GpProfile would surely take more time without these free components:</P>

<P>·BrowseFolder by Todd Fast</P>

<P>·EZDSL by Julian M Bucknall</P>

<P>·FPURLLabel by Filippo Passeggieri</P>

<P>·mPasLex and mwCustomEdit by Martin Waldenburg</P>

<P>·TRotateLabel by Jörg Lingner</P>

<P>·Widget by Robert R. Marsh, SJ</P>

<P>I would also like to thank a Richard Fellner, who donated a registered version of his beautiful installation program INF-TOOL.</P>

<P>Also, GpProfile wouldn't be the same without Uros Mesojedec, who created the program icon.</P>

<P>Delphi 2 version wouldn't be here without Fulvio Guzzon, who converted the gpprof.pas file.</P>

<P>I would like to thank Marko Bohanec and Andy Jeffries for providing me with a mirror download site.</P>

<P>John Hamm enhanced component gpArrowListView.</P>

<P>Source documentation is generated with Time2HELP, donated by Digital Logikk AS.</P>

<P>Links to components and their authors are available on the page http://www.eccentrica.org/gabr/gpprofile/credits.htm <IMG SRC="../images/bm0.gif" ALT="" BORDER=0> and in About window (select <B>Help.About</B> in GpProfile).</P>

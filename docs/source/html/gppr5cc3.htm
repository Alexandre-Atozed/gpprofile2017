<P>·Instrumenting the program with one comment type and then uninstrumenting with another type is a sure way to trash the program!</P>

<P>·GpProfile may display error Unable to replace image on startup and then terminate. This is caused by outdated comctl32 library. Get a new one from Microsoft ( http://www.microsoft.com/msdownload/ieplatform/ie/comctrlx86.asp <IMG SRC="../images/bm0.gif" ALT="" BORDER=0>).</P>

<P>·Because of a bug in an installation script GpProfile may not get correctly registered with Delphi when installed on Windows 95/98. If you can't find GpProfile entry in Tools menu, exit Delphi, run <I>GPPROF /REGISTER</I> and restart Delphi.</P>

<P>·$INCLUDE is only partially supported - included files are processed but procedures in included files cannot be instrumented.</P>

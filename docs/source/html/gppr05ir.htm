<P>GpProfile is free! You may use it any way you want, at home and at work, on as many computers as you want. You may download the source and write your own <A HREF="gppr6ng8.htm">profiler</A> based on the source. I won't mind. <B>But if you are a shareware writer and you like my profiler so much that you would like to donate a copy of your software for my personal use you can be sure I won't hold it against you!</B></P>

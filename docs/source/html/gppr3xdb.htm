<P>To instrument the Threads demo, select <B>Project.Instrument and Run</B>. This will instrument the program and open it in Delphi. You'll have to confirm that you want to reload changed files.</P>

<P><IMG SRC="../images/bm4.gif" ALT="" BORDER=0></P>

<P>If you have started GpProfile from Delphi IDE through the Tools menu, GpProfile will just switch back to Delphi. If you have started GpProfile without starting Delphi, a fresh Delphi will be started for you.</P>

<P>If you have more than one Delphi installed, you should select the version you want to use with <B>Project.Options</B> before selecting <B>Instrument and Run</B>.</P>

<P>When you are back in Delphi IDE, compile the program (Ctrl+F9) and run it. Don't just press F9 (Run) as Delphi usually just runs the old uninstrumented EXE even if it knows that some files have changed. Go figure.</P>

<P><IMG SRC="../images/bm5.gif" ALT="" BORDER=0></P>

<P>In the ThrdDemo program click <I>Start Sorting</I>. After the program finished its job, close it by clicking the X button in upper right corner. GpProfile will automatically pop up and open the recorded data.</P>

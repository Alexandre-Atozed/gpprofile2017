<P>To get more details, you should enable <A HREF="gppr1yyf.htm">caller</A>/<A HREF="gppr7tx3.htm">called</A> analysis. Select <I>Procedures</I> tab, then select <B>Layout.Show Called</B>. A new list with <I>Called procedures</I> will appear. When you click a procedure in <I>Procedures</I> list, <I>Called procedures</I> list will display all procedures that were called from the selected procedure. In our simple example, only one procedure (VisualSwap) was called.</P>

<P><IMG SRC="../images/bm9.gif" ALT="" BORDER=0></P>

<P>It is also possible to all procedures that called selected procedure. When Procedures tab is active, select <B>Layout.Show Callers</B>. To see it in action, select VisualSwap. Three procedures will appear in <I>Callers</I> list, showing that VisualSwap was called from <I>TBubbleSort.Sort, TSelectionSort.Sort, </I>and<I> TQuickSort.Sort</I>. Although <I>Callers</I> list displays caller names, all times in this list are times of selected procedure (<I>VisualSwap</I> in our example). Therefore, numbers in the following picture are telling us that <I>VisualSwap</I> took 1,707 seconds when called from <I>TBubbleSort.Sort</I>, 0,723 seconds when called from <I>TSelectionSort.Sort</I>, and 0,215 seconds when called from <I>TQuickSort.Sort</I>.</P>

<P>Although there is no much data displayed in this example, you can try browsing through the procedures. Just double click any procedure in <I>Callers</I> or <I>Called</I> list and it will become active procedure. You can return to the previous selection with <A HREF="gppr2kj7.htm">browser buttons</A>, positioned in upper right corner of <I>Procedures</I> tab.<I> </I></P>

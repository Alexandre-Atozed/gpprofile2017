<P>Functionally, GpProfile is divided into two parts - <A HREF="gppr3a5s.htm">Instrumentation</A> and Analysis. The user interface follows this division. The main part of GpProfile's form can be switched into instrumentation or analysis mode; there are two main toolbars, and two significant menus - Project (instrumentation part) and Profile (analysis part).</P>

<P>There is not much of the program dedicated for the housekeeping tasks. Beside the help system there are only two common functions - Preferences and Layout Manager, both accessible through the GpProfile menu or main (rightmost) toolbar.</P>

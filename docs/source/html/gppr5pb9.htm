<P>I want to keep distribution as small as possible. Therefore, GpProfile is distributed without a specialised installation program. All the work is done by Windows itself with a help of a very special program - <A HREF="gppr8po3.htm">INF-TOOL</A>.</P>

<P>Although installation is very simple, it is complete. If you are reading this, everything went well and GpProfile is installed and integrated with Delphi IDE.</P>

<P>Removal is also very simple - just select Add/Remove Program in Control Panel or Uninstall icon in GpProfile folder. Removal process will automatically remove Delphi IDE integration, GpProfile folder and all files.</P>

Fork with proper support for Delphi unicode versions (Delphi 2010 and higher).

Unit names with namespaces are supported now.

Tested with Delphi Seattle.

Additional features are:

- Using NameThreadForDebuggin()g for tracing the thread names in the result files.
- The PRF output filename can be now be configured using several placeholders, e.g. the ModuleName or the ProcessName and ID.
- The help system now uses CHM instead of HLP. HLP is not supported anymore by modern OSes.
